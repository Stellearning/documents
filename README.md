# Stellearning
Welcome to Stellearning
A New Way to Learn, Build, and Belong in Web3, Stellearning is an innovative educational platform designed to guide users through the world of Web3 by combining gamified onboarding and community-driven learning. We believe that blockchain technology can empower individuals — but only if they understand it. Stellearning makes that understanding fun, accessible, and verifiable.

What is Stellearning?
Stellearning is a two-phase Web3-native learning platform:
- Phase 1: Gamified Onboarding App
Users join through interactive quests and challenges that introduce core concepts of the decentralized world — from DeFi and NFTs to DAOs, GameFi, and dev tools. Whether you're a creator, a builder, or just Web3-curious, this phase provides a low-friction path to understanding.
- Phase 2: Course Marketplace & Certification
In the second phase, Stellearning becomes a full-fledged learning platform, where anyone — from individual instructors to DAOs — can publish and monetize educational content. Learners can receive verifiable on-chain certificates via NFTs, ensuring transparency and trust in credentialing.

Why Stellearning?
- Learn by Doing: Hands-on quests, not just videos or slides.
- Earn While Learning: Collect on-chain rewards for completing modules.
- Trust in Credentials: NFT-based certificates that can’t be faked.
- Community at the Core: Content and experiences co-created by builders, educators, and DAOs.
- Built on Stellar, Bridging Web2 and Web3: A seamless experience that combines the accessibility of Web2 with the power of Web3.

Who Is It For?
- Newcomers looking for an engaging way to enter the Web3 space.
- Educators and DAOs seeking a reliable way to distribute, tokenize, and monetize courses.
- Builders and Ecosystems aiming to onboard communities with clarity and scale.
- Freelancers and Independent Professionals aiming to gain trusted credentials and improve their skills.
- Companies and Organizations searching for verified talent with on-chain, fraud-proof certifications.
